The arkworks ecosystem consist of Rust libraries for designing and working with __zero knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments (zkSNARKs)__. This repository contains efficient implementations some of the key algebraic components underlying zkSNARKs: finite fields, elliptic curves, and polynomials.

This library is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Directory structure

This repository contains several Rust crates:  

* [`ark-ff`](ff): Provides generic implementations of various finite fields
* [`ark-ec`](ec): Provides generic implementations for different kinds of elliptic curves, along with pairings over these
* [`ark-poly`](poly): Implements univariate, multivariate, and multilinear polynomials, and FFTs over finite fields.
* [`ark-serialize`](serialize): Provides efficient serialization and point compression for finite fields and elliptic curves

In addition, the [`curves`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/curves) repository contains implementations of popular elliptic curves; see [here](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/curves/README.md) for details.

## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` toolchain of the Rust compiler (v 1.51+). To install the latest version of Rust, first install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via your platform's package manager. Once `rustup` is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:

```bash
rustup install stable
```

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra.git
cd algebra
cargo build --release
```

## Tests

This library comes with comprehensive unit and integration tests for each of the provided crates. Run the tests with:

```bash
cargo test --all
```

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, install the nightly Rust toolchain, via `rustup install nightly`, and then run the following command:

```bash
cargo +nightly bench
```

## Assembly backend for field arithmetic

The `ark-ff` crate contains (off-by-default) optimized assembly implementations of field arithmetic that rely on the `adcxq`, `adoxq` and `mulxq` instructions. These are available on most `x86_64` platforms (Broadwell onwards for Intel and Ryzen onwards for AMD). Using this backend can lead to a 30-70% speedup in finite field and elliptic curve arithmetic. To build with this backend enabled, run the following command:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+bmi2,+adx" cargo +nightly test/build/bench --features asm
```

To enable this in the `Cargo.toml` of your own projects, enable the `asm` feature flag:

```toml
ark-ff = { version = "0.1", features = [ "asm" ] }
```

Note that because inline assembly support in Rust is currently unstable, using this backend requires using the Nightly compiler at the moment.
