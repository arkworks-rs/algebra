### Breaking changes
- #20 (ark-poly) Move univariate DensePolynomial and SparsePolynomial into a 
    univariate sub-crate. Make this change by:
    find w/ regex `ark_poly::(Dense|Sparse)Polynomial`, and replace with `ark_poly::univariate::$1Polynomial`.
- #36 (ark-ec) In Short-Weierstrass curves, include an infinity bit in `ToConstraintField`.
- #37 (ark-poly) In the `Polynomial` trait, add `Hash` trait bound to `Point`.
- #38 (ark-poly) Add `Add` and `Neg` trait bounds to `Polynomial`.
- #51 (ark-ff) Removed `unitary_inverse` from `QuadExtField`. Make this change by
    replacing `x.unitary_inverse()` with `let mut tmp = x.clone(); tmp.conjugate()`
- #53 (ark-poly) Add `Zero` trait bound to `Polynomial`.
- #96 (ark-ff) Make the `field_new` macro accept values in integer form, without requiring decomposition into limbs, and without requiring encoding in Montgomery form.
- #106 (ark-ff, ark-ec) Add `Zeroize` trait bound to `Field, ProjectiveGroup, AffineGroup` traits.
- #108 (ark-ff) Add `extension_degree()` method to `Field`.
- #110 (ark-ec) Change the trait bound on the scalar for `mul`, from (essentially) `Into<BigInt>` to `AsRef<[u64]>`
- #117 (ark-poly) Make the univariate `SparsePolynomial` implement `Polynomial`. Make this change
    by replacing `sparse_poly.evaluate(pt)` to `sparse_poly.evaluate(&pt)`.
- #129 (ark-ff) Move `ark_ff::{UniformRand, test_rng}` to `ark_std::{UniformRand, test_rng}`.
    Importing these from `ark-ff` is still possible, but is deprecated and will be removed in the following release.
- #144 (ark-poly) Add `CanonicalSerialize` and `CanonicalDeserialize` trait bounds for `Polynomial`.
- #160 (ark-serialize, ark-ff, ark-ec) 
  - Remove `ConstantSerializedSize`; users should use `serialized_size*` (see next).
  - Add `serialized_size_with_flags` method to `CanonicalSerializeWithFlags`. 
  - Change `from_random_bytes_with_flags` to output `ark_serialize::Flags`.
  - Change signatures of `Flags::from_u8*` to output `Option`.
  - Change `Flags::from_u8*` to be more strict about the inputs they accept: 
    if the top bits of the `u8` value do *not* correspond to one of the possible outputs of `Flags::u8_bitmask`, then these methods output `None`, whereas before they output
    a default value.
  Downstream users other than `ark-curves` should not see breakage unless they rely on these methods/traits explicitly.
- #165 (ark-ff) Add `from_base_field_elements` as a method to the `Field` trait.
- #166 (ark-ff) Change `BigInt::{from_bytes, to_bits}` to `from_bytes_le, from_bytes_be, to_bits_le, to_bits_be`.
