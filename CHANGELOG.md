### Breaking changes
- #20 (ark-poly) Move univariate DensePolynomial and SparsePolynomial into a 
    univariate sub-crate. Make this change by:
    find w/ regex `ark_poly::(Dense|Sparse)Polynomial`, and replace with `ark_poly::univariate::$1Polynomial`.
- #36 (ark-ec) In Short-Weierstrass curves, include an infinity bit in `ToConstraintField`.
- #37 (ark-poly) In the `Polynomial` trait, add `Hash` trait bound to `Point`.
- #38 (ark-poly) Add `Add` and `Neg` trait bounds to `Polynomial`.

### Features
- #20 (ark-poly) Add structs/traits for multivariate polynomials
- #22 (ark-ec) Speedup fixed-base MSMs
- #28 (ark-poly) Add `domain()` method on the `evaluations` struct
- #31 (ark-ec) Speedup point doubling on twisted edwards curves
- #35 (ark-ff) Implement `ToConstraintField` for `bool`
- #48 (ark-ff) Speedup `sqrt` on `QuadExtField`


### Bug fixes
- #36 (ark-ec) In Short-Weierstrass curves, include an infinity bit in `ToConstraintField`.
