### Breaking changes
- #20 (ark-poly) Move univariate DensePolynomial and SparsePolynomial into a 
    univariate sub-crate. Make this change by:
    find w/ regex `ark_poly::(Dense|Sparse)Polynomial`, and replace with `ark_poly::univariate::$1Polynomial`.
- #36 (ark-ec) In Short-Weierstrass curves, include an infinity bit in `ToConstraintField`.
- #37 (ark-poly) In the `Polynomial` trait, add `Hash` trait bound to `Point`.
- #38 (ark-poly) Add `Add` and `Neg` trait bounds to `Polynomial`.
- #51 (ark-ff) Removed `unitary_inverse` from `QuadExtField`. Make this change by
    replacing `x.unitary_inverse()` with `let mut tmp = x.clone(); tmp.conjugate()`
- #53 (ark-poly) Add `Zero` trait bound to `Polynomial`.
- #106 (ark-ff, ark-ec) Add `Zeroize` trait bound to `Field, ProjectiveGroup, AffineGroup` traits.
- #108 (ark-ff) Add `extension_degree()` method to `Field`.
- #110 (ark-ec) Change the trait bound on the scalar for `mul`, from (essentially) `Into<BigInt>` to `AsRef<[u64]>`
- #117 (ark-poly) Make the univariate `SparsePolynomial` implement `Polynomial`. Make this change
    by replacing `sparse_poly.evaluate(pt)` to `sparse_poly.evaluate(&pt)`.
- #96 (ark-ff) Make the `field_new` macro accept values in integer form, without requiring decomposition into limbs, and without requiring encoding in Montgomery form.

### Bug fixes
- #36 (ark-ec) In Short-Weierstrass curves, include an infinity bit in `ToConstraintField`.
- #107 (ark-serialize) Fix handling of `(de)serialize_uncompressed/unchecked` in various impls of `CanonicalSerialize/Deserialize`.

- #119 (ark-poly) Fix bugs in degree calculation if adding/subtracting same degree polynomials
     whose leading coefficients cancel.
